# PST Viewer

PST Viewer is a web application that allows you to extract, view, and download data contained in a Microsoft Outlook PST (Personal Storage Table) file.

## Why was this project created?

This project was born out of the personal need to extract to-do lists from Microsoft To Do. Unfortunately, Microsoft does not provide a direct export of contents, but only allows you to export the entire account with all its contents.

Having found only installable programs, I decided to create this simple application to suit my needs.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies with the command:

```bash
yarn
```

## Usage

To start the application in development mode, run the command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

After uploading your PST file, you can view the contents and download them, starting from the folder where you are viewing the contents.
